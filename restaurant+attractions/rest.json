{"title": "Pistachio Grill", "description": "We had our anniversary dinner in Pistachio Grill. It's a relatively new establishment, in a unique setting -- it's inside a mall. There may be mixed responses about the mall setting from the other visitors; however, if you're a \"no-frills\" person, you will definitely love this place. The food was beyond amazing -- the chicken was juicy and tender, and...\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely Fantastic, extremely affordable Mediterranean food in Singapore. While the seating area is informal as it is located in a mall, don't let that fool you. The food is excellent. The service is excellent. The owners are extremely friendly. I look forward to my next trip to Singapore, so I can eat here again. Bring your own wine as they...\n\n\n\n\n\nI went to this restaurant not sure what to expect. Sometimes you read glowing reports in TripAdvisor and think, a Mediterranean restaurant set in the middle of shopping mall is a top ten restaurant in Singapore - really!?\nYes - really. The food is beautifully (I would say lovingly prepared). The ingredients are high quality and the flavors and preparation...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you angel, for putting a smile back on our faces with your kind review, it was such a pleasure serving you. It's guests like yourself that make us run the extra mile happily. Have a safe flight home, we look forward to welcoming you at Pistachio on your next trip!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe went here because of the TripAdvisor rating. It was out of the way for us in a modern strip mall. Food was quite good and interesting but the seating is just outside in the mall. Not very expensive and the Egyptian owner was very friendly and compted us baklava in a box. But come on, number 1 or 3...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your review which we had already anticipated when you said to our staff that we would fall off the Top 10 radar, even before you tasted our food. Guests who have dined at Pistachio were impressed with our food, hence they gave us top rating to express their appreciation. We prefer to be rated for our food...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.) Make reservation (way in advance).\n2.) Eat here.\n3.) Let me know if you know anywhere with better middle eastern cuisine.\n4.) If you think you know a better place, proceed to step 5.\n5.) You need to wake up coz you must be dreaming.\nMuch to my embarrassment, I came to know of this place, from visiting friends...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for highlighting the facts about Pistachio in such a concise and interesting manner. It's great to know that your friends from different parts of the Middle East enjoyed our food and found it authentic. We do not serve alcohol but we allow guests to bring their own wine when they celebrate special occasions at Pistachio.\nThank...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy friend introduced Paul me to Pistachio. It was the best day ever! The food was scrumptious! I had my birthday celebration there and Chef prepared a feast ! I have since returned numerous times & I was never disappointed with the quality of food! The Tomahawk is worth dieting for! I have introduced many friends & every one loves...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was also our best day ever to have met such a wonderful guest like you; thank you for your continued support and friendship. You are definitely one of our regular guests that we would do anything for because you bring us so much joy with your presence. Thank you also for spreading the word about Pistachio and filling it...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTook our friends there tonight, we had starters of the yummy dips and each of us had a main course, the mix grill, lamb shanks and moussaka with lamb chops! Every dish was cooked to perfection! Desserts so good!! Highly recommend this place anytime !!\n\n\nWe are thrilled to learn that you had a memorable dining experience at Pistachio. Thank you so much for your feedback. We will continue to do our best in serving quality food to our guests. Hope to see you again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a lovely meal here with friends. It is a laid back, unpretentious cafe located within a mall. The tables and chairs are set up in the atrium area but the food is good. Really really good. It is absolutely necessary to make reservations on the weekend as they have 2 seatings only and are usually full. Alcohol is not...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are glad that you made it to Pistachio eventually despite your busy schedule. Thank you so much for your kind review, we are very happy that our mission to serve quality food is greatly appreciated. You are spot-on in describing Pistachio as \"unpretentious\" as we are confident that the quality of our food speaks for itself. We look forward...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I had a wonderful 1st Wedding Anniversary dinner here. The quality of ingredients, all freshly made from scratch make the difference. The humus was the smoothest we have ever tasted and the home made garlic sauce was very light and goes well with any type of meat, especially the kebabs, as does their home made chili paste....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for celebrating your wedding anniversary at Pistachio. It's our honour to be a part of your happy occasion. Your sincere appreciation of our food brings us much joy and we look forward to having you and Myla back at Pistachio. We wish you many many more blissful years together!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazing food, good service. Value for money.\nRemmber to book.\nThe lamb shank is super. They have special menu which you can order in advance\nMust try.\n\n\nThank you very much for your kind review. We were equally wowed by your patience in waiting for a table to dine at Pistachio on a busy weekend afternoon. Glad to know that our lamb shank is greatly appreciated.

The food is nothing too exciting either. Oh an no specially nice views. Safve some money and go somewhere else.\n\nI have no idea why this is so highly rated. It is expensive for what you get - the mains are so small that you'll mistake them for a tasting menu. Some of the starters are like an amuse bouche. You're paying for the location and view.

Great menu, excellent wine selection....\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had the fixed price lunch menu which was really good value at 45sgd for 3 courses. The service and food were incredible.

{"title": "Restaurant Andre", "description": "An interesting experience - food was carefully planned and prepared by skilled chefs. A degustation menu was intricate and clever. The matching wine tasting was enjoyable and they presented one of the best champagnes I have ever sampled. Not all meals were to my taste but it was a positive experience. Take your check book. Cost for 3 was $2200.\n\nRestaurant Andre is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that gives that intimate and personal experience through the culinary journey and romantic surrounding; the others I could associate are Odette and Les Amis.\nIts standalone building in the historical location where old shop houses were still preserved gave a sense of nostalgia and romance.\nMy wife and I visited...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of the best and most amazing culinary experience ever. I have been to several Michelin restaurants and top world restaurants; however what set this apart from others is the element/themes chef Andre puts in each of the dish. You can taste not just the elements, but really feel the story and uniqueness behind each dish. Of course,...\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had been looking forward to dining at Andre's since the time of booking, which was well in advance.\nThe whole experience from service to quality of food and the personal attention to detail by the owners was exceptional. Plenty of reviewers have already given details, so won't repeat the accolades.\nWill we be back, definitely.\n\nThis is the second time I've been to restaurant Andre and it didn't disappoint. Granted the last time I was there was three years ago and I had forgotten some of the dishes I was served there. The service was impeccable and the ambiance was lovely. The food was delicious and there was only one dish that I didn't really...\n\n\n\n\n\nI must say that this is the second time, I have been dining at Restaurant Andre. The first time was 2 years ago and I must say I was blown away. The overwhelmingly excellent reviews speak for themselves and Andre is in the top 50 Restaurants of the world not without reason.\nComing back after two years, I was very...\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been to over 30 michelin 3stars restaurant all over the world, Most of Andre dishes are weak and lack in finesse in my opinion, a lot of it is a copy of other michelin restaurant that's presented differently but weak.\nAlso I don't think Andre understand what 3 star michelin service is or he just take advantages of singaporean...\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably one of the best meals I have had in my life! The service, ambience,food presentation and description and taste were unbelievable. This is an opportunity not to be missed by anyone interested in food. Just superb.\n\nDeservingly a 2 Michelin star restaurant, from the concept to the execution with excellent wine recommendations from the in-house sommelier. Worth the reservation waitlist.\n\nwoo super amazing meals ...\nwhat a pleasant surprises in between courses\nxceptional service with very dish beautifully crafted and presented as a work of art. The philosophical menu is based on Chef Andre's \u201cOctaphilosophy\u201d theme of eight dishes, representing Pure, Salt, Artisan, South, Texture, Unique, Memory and Terrior.

Service is impeccable as the staff are...\n\n\n\n\n\nMy wife and now count Colony's seafood buffet dinner as one of our best restaurant experiences, and best nights out, in town.

The wait staff are always top notch and...\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome food choice and excellent service.\nEspecially from Kethish and Auntie Angie.\nMy favorite would be the raw salmon and the chili crab!\n", "link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d8571637-Reviews-Colony-Singapore.html", "type": "restaurant", "location": "7 Raffles Avenue Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore | The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, Singapore 039799, Singapore ", "image": "", "price": 0, "channel": "", "category": "event", "time": ""},

I hesitate to post only because it's a small restaurant and very quaint ... had hoped to keep it a secret.
