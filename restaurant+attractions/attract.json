The bell of happiness is then rang to answer your wishes. This was a great experience and yes I definitely made a wish on a bell. This is located just behind the cable cars so you cannot miss it.\n\nFriends took us at night, which I would say is best. Otherwise you can get the Faber/Sentosa cable car and get off at the top before you go back across to Sentosa. Cooler up there as well.\n\nThe highest point of Singapore. And the third is Singapore Cable car station. The mountains around trees. And be careful there are no taxis in\n\nUse the cable car to reach the peak after that take a walk to faber point and downhill to hudson wave boardwalk.
