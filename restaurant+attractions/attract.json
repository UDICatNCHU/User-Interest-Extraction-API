A lot for flower and plant lovers to admire within a beautiful structure for those who love architecture!\n\nVisit to the Gardens by the bay cannot be complete without visiting the 2 Air conditioned domes. There is a good collection of flowers which can be a photographers delight. The Air conditioning also provides a welcome respite from the sultry Singapore heat outside. There were a lot of Christmas related decorations during our visit.\nNice place to visit\n\nWe really wish we went when it was not so busy. This conservatory was stunning, Tulipmania at the moment, but we were put off by how many people wanted photos in with the flowers or selfies more than just admiring the flowers themselves.\n\nThis place offers stunning flora for viewing pleasure. We were lucky enough to experience the Tulip Festival over here. There were loads of Tulips and my my! What lovely creations they are. Was amazed at the engineering of the dome as the temperature was low and it was cool for some of the plants to survive coming from a hot...\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n\nVisited in August with my sister. We got our tickets from busonlinetickets (portal) and paid only $22 per person for entry to Cloud Forest & Flower Dome (which was cheaper than booking from the official website or buying at the entrance). Getting there was pretty easy, its 100-200m walk from the MRT at Marina Bay. The walking track to the...\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n\nThe flowers were been changed with the season so it will look different. I loved this as well and great for all ages. I come here when sakura blossom. Its very nice :)\nLoved every moment I was there and can't rave enough about this garden. A must see if it's the one thing you do in Singapore.\n\nAll the flowers and plants are well taken care of. The building was quite comfortably air conditioned.\n\nAs we are in Garden by the Bay, we visited all the surrounding attractions and though a bit pricy but it is worth it. We see all the different flowers and it is like basking in the flowers as we are surround by the flowers. Refreshing trip\n\nThe beauty of this place takes you away from the troubles of the world. There is such a variety of habitats and plants that you will want to go back and look again.\n\nThe flower dome very interesting and Very Very Very beautiful especially Tulip garden that's colorful. There are many kind of flowers too. Don't miss it if you are in Singapore.\n",

The rainforest area has free-ranging animals (lemurs, bats, mouse deer, squirrels, and huge numbers of birds) that offer countless opportunities for amazing up-close photos. Token feedings (SG$5) are an excellent means of interacting with the animals (rhinos, elephants, giraffes,...) and are...\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n\nZoo never fascinates me and especially after coming back from Safari trip in Masai Mara. On my first trip to Singapore I skipped the zoo for the same reason but this time based on the reviews and considering I had a 4 years old daughter with me I took a chance and wow it did not disappoint me a bit....\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n\nHad a wonderful time here with friends and our 5 month old baby. Such a beautiful Zoo (really lush!) and, although they make you pay for the different parts separately (the zoo, river safari and night zoo), it is worth it.

Take your umbrella just in case through!\nHighlights...\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n\nAll of the animals appeared to be in excellent health considering, the high humidity did detract from the visit somewhat, however there were a couple of exhibits that were popular due to the air conditioning (namely where the polar bear was!) so it was a good time. I would expect it to be busy at peak times though. We visited...\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n\nSingapore has much to choose from, so the question was whether spending half a day of our short layover would be time well spent. For us it definitely was. There is a lot of diversity with respect to animal species and the fact that monkeys are roaming around added in different places made it extra special. A great day out,...\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n\nSingapore Zoo is one of the better I have seen. The grounds are well maintained and they are very nice to walk around. The Zoo is split into different Zones to easily group the animals.

It is well managed and clean. If you have the choice then please avoid going on weekends, school and public holidays because it gets really crowded. Take the tramp if your have weak legs or are with some elderly folks. Yes, I forget...NEVER ON A RAINY DAY! Catch the live shows and feeding times....\n\n\nMore  \n\n\n",

You can spend a pleasant afternoon here no problems and have a good long walk as well.\n\nWell worth the visit just to see the wide range of colours. There is a cool room that you can visit if you are finding the heat and humidity a little too much. We also bought some ceramic orchids to stick on our fridge to remember it by. The number of orchids on display was overwhealming.\n\nI was shocked on the amount of different kinds of Orchids here. 1000 kinds and 2000 hybrids is impressive. The whole garden is beautiful and if you like Orchids you can't leave Singapore without visiting this place.\n\nIf you are a garden lover the National Orchid Garden is worth a walk around, the displays are amazing, it was very hot when we were there but you can always stop and one of the cafes for a cold drink.\n\nIt is just amazing to see all the different types of orchids in one garden. The place is extremely well maintained. Photography buffs will have a field day shooting all the flowers.\n\nThis orchid garden is exquisite, a must see for orchid lovers. So many varieties on display. Take a hat and some water as it can be very warm walking around.\n\nA must if you love orchids as it has many species and the landscape is beautiful .\nEntrance fee is S$2.00 and during school holidays it can be FREE\n\nDo not miss this site, especially if you like orchids. The grounds are breathtakingly beautiful! The gift shop carries some unique items as well.\n\nIt was my first time there. Had expected a small garden but the orchid garden was quite big but lots of varieties. It Wil be a great place for tourists as the entry fee is very very low.\n\nWasn't sure what to expect but this was brilliant. I never thought there were so many different orchids in the world. It takes quite a while to walk round and see everything but well worth the time taken.\n",

A number of shady spots that's good for resting, bring your own picnic basket.\n\nA gorgeous walk to go on when in Singapore! We got a taxi and asked to be taken to the Southern Ridges not knowing where was the best place to start. He literally dropped us off in the middle of the road and told us it’s a good place to start!
