A few moments later, he looked back at his fianc\u00e9e and nodded somberly as relatives of the victims sobbed loudly. A defense attorney hugged him.After six days of deliberations, the jury found Hernandez not guilty of first-degree murder in the killings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. It convicted him of a single charge: unlawful possession of a gun. The judge sentenced him to an additional four to five years in prison, separate from his existing life sentence.Aaron Hernandez, 27, is currently serving a life sentence for a 2013 murder.\u00a0AP Photo/Stephan SavoiaSuffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said the victims' families were devastated by the verdicts as well as by the defense's portrayal of the men as \"gang bangers\" and \"drug dealers.\"\"These were two hardworking, humble, Cape Verdean immigrants,\" Conley said. \"It was unnecessary and it was wrong, and it shouldn't have been done.\"Conley said prosecutors and the families take solace in the fact that Hernandez is serving a life sentence in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e. Prosecutors in the double-murder trial weren't allowed to mention his conviction in Lloyd's case.\"One of the victims' relatives said, 'At least he's not walking out the door today,'\" Conley said.But Jose Baez, one member of Hernandez's defense team, told ESPN's Ian O'Connor that he sees a path for the Lloyd conviction to be overturned.\"I wish he'd called me (for the first trial),\" said Baez, who was not in court Friday because of a back issue. \"I think there are plenty of flaws in that (Lloyd) conviction. If they are exposed properly, he certainly can and should get a new trial.\"The defense team in the double-murder case had pointed the finger at Alexander Bradley, an admitted drug dealer and a close friend of Hernandez who was with him the night of the shootings. The defense hammered at Bradley's credibility, citing his immunity deal with prosecutors to testify against Hernandez, his role as the driver of the car the night of the shootings and his criminal record. Bradley is serving a five-year prison term in Connecticut for firing shots at a Hartford nightclub in 2014.Bradley testified that Hernandez became enraged after de Abreu bumped into him while dancing, spilling his drink at a Boston nightclub. He said Hernandez later opened fire on the men's car as they waited at a stoplight.Prosecutors charged Hernandez with shooting Bradley in the face months after the double slaying to try to silence him as a witness. Bradley lost his right eye; Hernandez was acquitted of witness intimidation.Defense attorney Ronald Sullivan Jr. said the jury was able to see through the \"smoke and mirrors\" that made up the state's case. He described Hernandez as a \"very good young man who happened to hang out with a very bad guy in Alexander Bradley.\"Conley said Friday that prosecutors would not go after Bradley in the killings because they believe they already charged the right person.\"Our theory of the case stands,\" Conley said. \"In our minds, [the evidence] points inescapably to Aaron Hernandez.\"Jury forewoman Lindsey Stringer read a statement outside court, noting the more than 70 witnesses and over 380 exhibits presented in the case.\"We based our decision on the evidence presented and the law,\" Stringer said. She took no questions.Prosecutors introduced evidence at trial that Hernandez got a tattoo that memorialized the double slaying. California tattoo artist David Nelson testified that Hernandez requested an image of a revolver with the gun barrel facing forward. Hernandez wanted five bullets visible in the cylinder of the gun and one cylinder empty, Nelson said.Authorities said Hernandez fired five shots from a revolver into the car carrying de Abreu and Furtado.Hernandez, 27, grew up in Bristol, Connecticut, and played for the Patriots from 2010 to 2012. About six weeks after Furtado and de Abreu were killed, Hernandez signed a five-year, $40 million contract with the Patriots and went on to play another season before Lloyd was killed. He was cut from the team shortly after he was arrested in Lloyd's killing in June 2013. He was not charged in the 2012 killings until 2014.Baez, the attorney known for winning an acquittal for Florida mom Casey Anthony in the death of her daughter, told ESPN that \"(Hernandez) is one step closer to being reunited with his family. He still has the appeal (of the Lloyd conviction), and those appeals can be overturned.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nSuffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said the victims' families were devastated by the verdicts as well as by the defense's portrayal of the men as \"gang bangers\" and \"drug dealers.\"", "link": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/19159319/jury-acquits-ex-new-england-patriots-tight-end-aaron-hernandez-double-murder-trial"}, {"title": "Jackson says Melo 'better off somewhere else'", "category": "news", "type": "sports", "channel": "ESPN", "time": "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:10:58 EST", "location": "United States", "price": 0, "image": "", "description": "Phil Jackson talks about the exit meeting he and Carmelo Anthony shared and the new direction he hopes to take New York.

As the top-seeded Celtics prepare for their first-round matchup with the eighth-seeded Chicago Bulls, they are well aware of Rondo's propensity to elevate his play when the games matter most.Bulls guard Rajon Rondo is known for stepping up his game when it matters most, something not lost on his former Boston teammates.\u00a0John E. Sokolowski/USA TODAY Sports\"I'm a fan of the game. I know, whether he tries it or not, those big games he's always gonna be ready for them,\" Thomas said Friday after the Celtics went through their first workout of the postseason. The Celtics host the Bulls in Game 1 on Sunday night at TD Garden.\"He's always gonna play his best [in big games],\" said Thomas. \"And that's just me watching him when I was younger and before I got in the NBA. You know, when it counts, he's gonna be ready and he's gonna perform. So we've got to slow him down and eliminate what he does best, and that's getting everyone involved.\"If there's one obvious advantage the Bulls possess in this first-round matchup, it's playoff experience. Rondo and teammate Dwyane Wade have combined to play in 260 postseason games and win four NBA championships. Yes, both are different players in the latter stages of their careers, but they know how to win on the big stage.This young Celtics core, helmed by Thomas, has been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in each of the past two seasons.\"Rondo's a hell of a guard and then you've got Dwyane Wade and Jimmy Butler and you've just got to make it hard for them, make it tough for them,\" Thomas said. \"Don't let them see anything easy. It's not just gonna be an individual defensive matchup. As a team, as a collective group, we've got to let them see five guys every time down. I mean Dwyane Wade is a guy that's won championships, so he knows what to expect. We've got to be ready and I think we're ready for the opportunity.\"Said Celtics coach Brad Stevens: \"I've watched [Rondo and Wade] for way before I was in the NBA. I'm pretty sure we're going to get great shots from both of them.\"Thomas is also certain that Boston fans are going to shower Rondo with affection for what he meant to the 2008 championship team and Boston's playoff success in the years that followed, including deep postseason runs in 2010 and 2012.\"He won a championship here so they love the guy,\" said Thomas. \"It won't be no bad feelings. I've heard if you win a championship here they're gonna love you forever, so he's earned that and he's one of the best guards to ever play.\"Thomas hasn't proved himself as a winner in the postseason, but he's highly motivated to do so this year, especially after a regular season in which he put himself in the MVP conversation with his offensive wizardry.When asked about what to expect from Thomas in the postseason, he smiled and said, \"I'm ready for it.\"Bradley, easily the longest-tenured player on Boston's roster despite being only 26 years old, fondly recalled what Rondo meant to him as a younger player.\"Rondo's like my brother. On the court, off the court, we're brothers,\" said Bradley. \"It's weird playing against him, going up against him, but I think I said it last game: I know he's a true competitor and he's going to bring his best game in the playoffs. So it's going to be fun playing against him. Weird but fun.\"I grew as a player and as a man. He's helped me out in a lot of different ways. And I appreciate him. All his time here I feel like he was one of the best teammates that I've had. And he was a true competitor, one of the hardest-playing teammates I played with.\"His desire to win, I don't know that many people (like that). He's so competitive. It doesn't matter what we're playing. If we're playing tic-tac-toe he wants to win every single game. So I respect that about him.\"Bradley said it was hard to watch Rondo struggle to perform like the franchise player he was in Boston during combustible stints in Dallas and Sacramento. And, from afar, Bradley remained supportive of Boston's former captain.\"It was hard hearing all the negative things about him,\" said Bradley. \"But I just prayed for him. I wished him well. I would send him texts every now and then like, 'Bro, it doesn't matter.' We've all been there before. He's been the underdog before. He came into the NBA, people not thinking he could play. Everybody's been there. It's just their job to continue to work and prove people wrong. I feel like every year he's been trying to do that.\"\n\"I'm a fan of the game. I know, whether he tries it or not, those big games he's always gonna be ready for them,\" Thomas said Friday after the Celtics went through their first workout of the postseason.

For Kate and Charlotte, growing up with eight other siblings meant having nine best friends for life. They wondered what it would be like to have only one sibling and not get along with them, or what dinner would be like without the noise.", "link": "http://www.espn.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/19151731/boston-marathon-2017-cipolletti-siblings-take-starting-line-honor-their-sister-emily"}, {"title": "Runner Jordan Hasay's stride into 26.1 miles", "category": "news", "type": "sports", "channel": "ESPN", "time": "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 17:07:25 EST", "location": "United States", "price": 0, "image": "", "description": "Running always has come easy for Jordan Hasay. While other kids thought of it as punishment, it was her joy. Her daily highlight in fifth grade was running laps to start PE class. \"I would be literally sitting on the edge of my seat in class,\" she says, \"just waiting for the bell to ring so I could be the first person out the door. I had to win that little two-lapper.\" Even then, she loved the freedom and challenge of running. \"I loved pushing myself,\" she recalls.Hasay became a high school phenom in San Luis Obispo, California, and a star at the University of Oregon, where she was a 15-time All-American and two-time NCAA indoor champion in the mile and 3,000 meters. Though she's only 25, she's been in the national running spotlight for a dozen years.Since graduating from college, Hasay -- known for her hard-charging style and long, blond braid -- has been coached by Alberto Salazar as part of the Nike Oregon Project, with her focus on the 5,000 and 10,000 meters.However, Hasay has changed course since the 2016 Olympic trials, where she was a disappointing ninth in the 10K and 13th in the 5K after recovering from plantar fasciitis in 2015. She's taken to the roads and stretched her distance. In October she won the USATF 10 Mile Championship. In her half-marathon debut in Houston in January, she finished fourth, running 1 hour, 8 minutes, 40 seconds, the sixth-fastest time ever for an American woman. She topped that April 1 with a 1:07.55 at the Prague Half Marathon, the third-best time ever for an American, while finishing sixth. She also won the USATF 15K championship in March with a fierce finishing kick.", "link": "http://www.espn.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/19092276/boston-marathon-2017-runner-jordan-hasay-stride-261-miles"}, {"title": "The UFC new star and a forgotten NBA pioneer", "category": "news", "type": "sports", "channel": "ESPN", "time": "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 07:17:14 EST", "location": "United States", "price": 0, "image": "", "description": "sports + biz + culture + life\nGet REDEF delivered to your inboxrantnrave:// Mike Oz's opening 25-year-old baseball cards series is consistently entertaining.
