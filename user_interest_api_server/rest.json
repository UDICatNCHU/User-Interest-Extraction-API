We are thrilled to know that every item served on your first visit was well-received.

Initially we were a little hesitant as it appeared the restaurant was merely a Take-Away, and then surprised that the seating was in front, but in the middle of the mall. That hesitation quickly passed as were warmly greeted by our hostess, Agnes, owner of the Pistachio Grill....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a great pleasure having you and your family at Pistachio, and thank you so much for your well wishes. We're very happy to hear that our food won your attention, that's most important to us.

Not only were our stomachs well taken care of, Chef Khaled, Agnes and their team ensured that we had a enjoyable dining experience with their great hospitality. Will definitely be back again!\n\n\nThank you for trying us out and for taking time to write us a review. We are glad that you and your family had a memorable dinner. Hope to have the pleasure of having you all back at Pistachio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood that is absolutely fresh and made simple. Fact is simple dishes are the most difficult to stand out. I must say the chef here put his heart and soul into his food served. Simple deco and no flashy decorations. The food served does the talk. A must try.\n\n\nThe greatest compliment to a chef is the sincere appreciation of his food, and not the peripheral elements. Thank you so much!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot your usual Orchard Road or trendy hip location downtown but in the middle of a shopping centre concourse off Balestier Rd. It seems an unlikely place to find an authentic Middle Eastern restaurant owned by Egyptian chef Khaled who is a charming soft spoken man and his lively Singapore wife Agnes. Make a point of ordering the Roast Short...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for taking time to write us this review. Yes, Pistachio is a place where you can expect the unexpected.
